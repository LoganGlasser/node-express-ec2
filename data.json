    "caption": "He was waiting for a bus, in the rain. The street was dark, and lit only by a dim and buzzing lamp overhead. And although no one could see it, his eyes were unfocused, only vaguely directed downwards perhaps due to his sagging head. He’d evidently forgotten his umbrella, and as the rain plummeted on to the unmoving figure, each drop impacted as if to push him out of his trance. But they weren’t enough. Because he was not concerned with the water seeping through his jacket, or his own shivering form hidden beneath. There on that dark and raining street, the person who waited for a bus to come… was afraid. What he was afraid of is hard to say for me, because he said nothing. There was no one to speak to after all. I imagined what the hollow look in his eyes may denote a fear of. A farm. For him. He worried that his life was akin to that of a domesticated animal, and the turning gears for which he had no ability to perceive even while they ground him into a form which he did not belong in, would never cease their turning as he did not understand what they were. He was worried that he would watch himself die, and somehow have to carry on living in that smoldering crater of what was once purpose. The rain pooled in his pockets, running down his sleeves. However, that was not truly what mortified him. A thought that he was too terrified to revisit once its time plaguing his mind had subsided. His ultimate fear- that he would not care. You see, he believed that within him resided a spark. A spark capable of incredible things, that would unleash an unflinching will wielding power equivalent to its indomitability, after igniting his very own soul. The winds blew through his soaked coat, chilling him to his core, while his body redoubled its desperate shivering. What he feared most of all was that his spark would ignite nothing. That his soul was not kindling at all. That his spark would burn forever in his heart, its flames riding up his inner walls only to scorch and torment him. He was afraid that even as he was ground up as he’d seen countless times before, he wouldn’t put up a fight.  The bus was not coming. It was already far too late for that. - Farm, happy halloween"

I am praying, worshipping. But... in that moment, my hand was descending. It came toward my back. My leg moved, as if to stand. I am reaching towards something. Something I have always felt was there. Covered in vines, leaves, mushrooms, flowers. Untouched for so very long. \"I am no one\". The words leak out of the mask like blood spilling from a wound. The laughing is cacophonous, it's ringing in my ears, as if it's coming from my own mouth. I was reaching for your glory, was I not? The nobility of it all howls the loudest. \"I am nothing\". My hand is almost to the blade. Not a tool, a weapon. Not meant to build, meant to take. My heartbeat drums in head, competing with the sickening sound of laughter. How long have I been about to seize the blade for? I am trapped. In an eternal moment of reach. Your perfection is unattainable. And there is nothing on my back. Why then? Why can I feel its weight? I know it's there... I know it..."

In the silence, nothing became known to me, I had known the weapon was there all along. Tearing the mask from my face did not reveal an identity huddled away underneath. My body tensed and drew the sword as if it were to deliver a swing with the same motion. The plants once entangling the weapon surged forward to mimic my movement. But there was nothing to attack. My moment of determination was slipping into pointlessness. So I focused my eyes on you. You who I worshipped, you who I dreamt of being. \"I am my influence\" I say to open air. There is no confirmation, no repercussion, no conclusion. Briefly, the thought of cutting you down is considered. But just as surely I know the sword is there, I know it is not meant for that. It is enough that I have claimed identity, and escaped one more endless moment."

Now, no one has come out of an entrance in nearly a century. But in recent times, the beckoning doorways have appeared more and more frequently, and disappeared less and less. As if the gaping maw of the beast pushes outward in a slow but deliberate hunger.   You are a magician of the grand academy. A student, your boundless curiosity has driven you to study the arcane ways. And now, it drives you to a door. It opened not too far from your home and hasn't disappeared for days. As if inviting you, its call is tantalizing. One day you stand before it. As the door creaks open, you feel a tremble go down your spine. Suddenly you are absolutely terrified. Petrified with fear, you can hardly put a foot forward... or flee the maddening sight in front of you... Do you go in?"

There are scorch marks around its base, and smoke billows out of its every crevice. The green moss and vines which once crept out from beneath are now no more than stains of ash streaking across the silver surface of the armor.  You cross the river and continue on your way. But, with the smoldering guardian fading behind you, you wonder what exactly you destroyed, and why ever would the grass and fungi stand only to guard a lonely bridge."

It was instantaneous, and you only retained any vague idea of what could have happened because of the feeling of the flames, but somehow you were completely engulfed, as if the fire itself was at its wit's end and was lashing out against its environment.

The one who had operated the gravity defying device moved frantically, and retrieved a sort of string, or a necklace, from a nearby pedestal. You could hardly understand what they said but you made out these words: \"Complete the talisman...its shape will give you power....\""
